Installation Instructions

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/AlderPlanetarium/RoverVideo

cd into directory
cd RoverVideo

Make sure the installation scrip is executable
chmod +x install_video.sh

Run the installation script with root privilages
(These are necessary because it's installing programs to
/usr/local/bin and modifying files in the /etc/ and /etc/init
directories)
sudo ./install_video.sh

These were the steps I had to take to get the files to install on
the rovers; however, it seems like it should be possible to simply 
execute install_video.sh from the flash drive. Maybe I had mounted
it incorrectly. Anyway the method above should work. 

Usage:

The streaming server is set up as an Ubuntu Upstart service, and 
begins running as soon as the local filesystem is mounted and the
networking is operational. It is set to respawn a new server if it 
crashes. It uses the Ubuntu default we're it will try to respawn 
10 times with a 5 second pause between each attempt. 

If you need to start the server manually you can enter 
sudo start video-server

If you need to stop the server manually you can enter
sudo stop video-server

There is also a service, called video-cam, that sends video from the
webcam to the server. It starts and stops automatically when the server
starts. There should be no need to start/stop it independently of the
server. 

The server is accessible over port 8081 and produces two streams:
webcam.flv and webcam.swf. Both should stream at a resolution of 
480x320, which was selected because it seemed the best compromise
between video lag and quality. 

The complete URL for each steam is: 
http://[ROVER_NAME or IP_ADDRESS]:8081/webcam.swf
http://[ROVER_NAME or IP_ADDRESS]:8081/webcam.flv

If you'd like to make changes to the quality/resolution/encoding 
of the streams (or create more formats) you can edit ffserver configuration
file at /etc/ffserver.conf.
